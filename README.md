# LinearRegression

Hi

In this project i focused on predicting price of houses using Linear Regression.
1. At the beginning i prepered dataset in file house_sales.csv ( deleting irrelevant columns, setting target column, creating dummy varibles).
2. My next task was deleting corelated columns ( i'd like to avoid collinearity)
3. Then i fitted Linear Regression Model and calculated R^2 value.
4. After that i examinated the significance of regression parameters.
5. At the end i described results of model.
